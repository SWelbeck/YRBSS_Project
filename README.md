Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System Classification Project

## Business Problem
Behaviors developed at a young age can and often does follow us into adulthood. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) is the "largest public health surveillance system in the United States, monitoring a broad range of health-related behaviors among high school students," and allows researchers and others to study just how certain behaviors and actions can contribute to deteriorating mental health and risky sexual behaviors amongst other aspects of health. The surveys are conducted every two years at high schools across the country. The topics covered in the survey include behaviors which contribute to injury and violence, sexual behaviors, alcohol and drug use, tobacco use, dietary behaviors and physical activity. We look to determine which factors have a great bearing on whether a youth may consider suicide and whether they may engage in risky sexual behavior.
